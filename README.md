2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to launch the Etch-a-Sketch application.

## Usage

1. **Select the Size:** When you first open the application, you'll be prompted to select the size of the drawing board. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the prompt and press "Select." This will determine the grid size for your drawing board.

## Customization

The Etch-a-Sketch application offers some customization options:

- You can change the default background image by replacing the `backg.png` file in the project directory.
